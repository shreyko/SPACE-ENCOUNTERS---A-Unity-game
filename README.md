# SPACE-ENCOUNTERS---A-Unity-game
The second iteration of Space Encounters, implemented using Unity's game engine

This is an under-development Unity game project, it is a simple space odyssey game, that is meant to provide a casual and fun experience using simple controls, limited items, and level progression. 
The current version of the game implementation has an item shop, ad sense, in-game currency, level progression, different enemies, health status, and much more.

### The Future of this project

This is still very much a work in progress, I have chosen to make the game files and assets public so people can track my progress and also use some of my code to implement certain features in their own projects. This game is NOT intended for release but rather as a fun follow along project that helps me learn and keeps me updated.
I do plan to create a more enjoyable production-ready game using Unity's game engine, and would release the progress logs on my website: "shreyko.github.io"
